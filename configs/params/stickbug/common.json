        Essentially, this tells the plane that after losing RC communications for
        3 minutes, it should attempt to terminate flight by crashing.

        However, whether or not the plane will actually execute the terminate command
        depends on the value of AFS_TERM_ACTION. If AFS_TERM_ACTION is 42 or 43 then
        the plane will actually terminate flight by initating a crash. If it is any
        other number, then it won't actually terminate flight.

        We set AFS_TERM_ACTION accordingly in the other, more specific, configs.
