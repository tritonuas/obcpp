/**
 * Try and remove this. Just try it, dummy.
 * 
 * Ok, but seriously. DON'T DELETE THIS FILE. You might think, "there's no fucking way
 * this file is actually doing anything." And if you were to remove this file and then
 * remove the reference to it in src/CMakeLists.txt and recompile, it would look like you
 * were correct! It will be fine!
 * 
 * But if you do do this--and I would encourage you to try!--see what happens if you reclone
 * the repo or rm -rf your build directory. You will get some unholy error message complaining
 * about some nonexistent file deep in the bowels of the build directory.
 * Then you'll come crying back to your daddy and begging for a git restore src/dummy.c,
 * like the dummy you are.
 * 
 * Don't be a dummy, and don't delete this file.
 * 
 * (for more information, see the stackoverflow post linked in src/CMakeLists.txt)
